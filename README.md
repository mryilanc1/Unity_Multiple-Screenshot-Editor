# Unity Screenshot Editor

Benefiting the Recorder package, I wrote an editor for getting ScreenShots for different resolutions at once.

Enter the resolution you want and auto-save with code into the json file. Take batch screenshots for different devices at once whenever you want.

Example:
You will be able to take screenshots for iphone 13 pro max, iphone 8 plus, iphone 12, devices with one click. 



### You need to install the recorder package for use this editor
