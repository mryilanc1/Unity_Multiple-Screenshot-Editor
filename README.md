# Unity Screenshot Editor

Benefiting the Recorder package, I wrote an editor for getting ScreenShots for different resolutions at once.

Enter the resolution you want and auto-save with code into the json file. Take batch screenshots for different devices at once whenever you want.

Example:
You will be able to take screenshots for iphone 13 pro max, iphone 8 plus, iphone 12, devices with one click. 

............................

resolution records are saved as json file in Resources folder.

### You need to install Unity's recorder package for use this editor

............................

You can learn "How to use this editor ?" on youtube video
