Multiple Screenshot Editor (Tool-Ultilities)

Benefiting the Recorder package, I wrote an editor for getting ScreenShots for different resolutions at once.

Enter the resolution you want and auto-save with code into the json file. Take batch screenshots for different devices at once whenever you want.

Example: You will be able to take screenshots for iphone 13 pro max, iphone 8 plus, iphone 12, devices with one click.

............................

resolution records are saved as json file in Resources folder.

You need to import Unity's recorder package for use this editor
